This one guys, I tried it on Binance and it was working. I was a total noob and I got scared when I saw it start buying like crazy.

It was made by a really smart guy. I don't know as much about this one as I do the Anderson Strat with EMAGAIN.

Would you guys be so kind as to look it over and leave me some comments @cryptobri on Telegram?

This could be a nice little community project where we all colaborate to make it better.

This one has the BTC price rise and drop triggers which are not supposed to work on Binance, but it was working.

If it starts throwing errors on Binance, comment those out.
