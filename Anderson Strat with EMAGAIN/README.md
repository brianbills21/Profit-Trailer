 This one is for Binance and it started making me $300 a day with a budget of .2 BTC.
 
 I started with $2600 and today on 01/02/2017 at 8:36 AM -8 GMT I have $3210, that's less than 2 full days of trading.
 
 With this strategy, I have a setting that will pay to keep dust from accumulating, all you have to do is
 
 buy 2 BNB tokens (Current Price Per Token $8.70) on Binance and leave them in there.
 
 If you want to, but you don't have to, please donate whatever you can.

 BTW, don't panic when you see PT start buying up everything in site and leaving you with a low BTC balance,
 
 it clears the bags in less than a day.
 
 Oh and, if you want to HODL a percentage of you BTC without spending it all, here are some parameters:
 
 THE PRICE IN BTC YOU WILL MAKE THE FIRST BUY AT:
 
    ALL_max_cost = 0 
    ALL_max_cost_percentage = 1 
    ALL_min_buy_balance = 0 
    ALL_min_buy_balance_percentage = 60
 
 This preserves 60% of your BTC balance.
 
 But truthfully, I don't care what form my money is in, I want max profits.
