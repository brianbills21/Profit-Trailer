## Condition for using this strategy:

- When you look on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/), and you see most of the Alts in green accross the board.

- And if BTC is failrly stable, `if that's possible`, then go ahead and use this setting.

## Warning 

- These settings will use up all your BTC in trades, and you have to keep a really close eye on BTC.

- If BTC starts going up or down more than 5%, take these settings out right away and put your more conservative settings back in.

## Notes:

- This one is for Binance and it started making me $300 a day with a budget of .2 BTC.
 
- I started with a total value of $2600 and today on 01/02/2018 at 8:36 AM -8 GMT I have $3210, that's less than 2 full days of trading.
 
- To avoid dust and get 0.25 off on fees, use this setting: `BNBBTC_trading_enabled = false` and buy 2 or 3 BNB tokens `(Current Price Per Token $8.70 01/02/2018 at 8:36 AM -8 GMT)`.
 
## BTW: 

- Don't panic when you see PT start buying up everything in site and leaving you with a low BTC balance.
 
- It clears the bags in less than a day if you're patient.
 
- Oh and, if you want to reserve a percentage of your BTC without spending it all, here are some parameters:
```
 THE PRICE IN BTC YOU WILL MAKE THE FIRST BUY AT:
 
    ALL_max_cost = 0 
    ALL_max_cost_percentage = 1 
    ALL_min_buy_balance = 0 
    ALL_min_buy_balance_percentage = 60
 ```
- This preserves 60% of your BTC balance.
 
- But truthfully, I don't care what form my money is in, I want max profits.

- So when Alts are bullish, I let PT spend everything on trades until I see too much BTC movement.

- If you want to, but you don't have to, please donate whatever you can.
